  Auto script for Reddit Robin
  Start it with
    xidel --template-file reddit-robin.xml 
  to set it to GROW once. It will ask for username and password.
  
  You can also pass username and password on the command line as
    xidel -e 'user := "your name", passwd := "your password"' --template-file reddit-robin.xml 

  Or on bash with: 
     export user=name
     export passwd=password
    xidel --variable user,passwd --template-file reddit-robin.xml
