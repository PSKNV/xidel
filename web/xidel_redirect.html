<h1>Xidel: Command line web page scraper and XQuery engine</h1>

Xidel is a command line tool to download web pages and extract data from them. 
<p>This data can be extracted using XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 expressions, CSS 3 selectors, and custom, pattern-matching templates that are like an annotated version of the processed page. 

<p>It can download files over HTTP/S connections, follow redirections, links, or extracted values, and also process local files. 

<p>The extracted values can then be exported as plain text/XML/JSON, or assigned to variables to use in other extract expressions. 

<p>It also provides an <a href="http://videlibri.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xidelcgi">online CGI service</a> for testing of XPath 2.0 / XQuery expressions. 

<p>(Xidel is a part of the VideLibri project, so its project page just redirects <a href="http://videlibri.sourceforge.net/xidel.html">there</a> )
