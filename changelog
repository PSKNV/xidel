Some important changes:

--------Xidel 0.7--------

* Improved handling of extract/follow command line chains:
  Following occurs in depth-first-search
  Brackets [ ] can be used to group arguments together (e.g. [ -f //a -e //title ] to read the titles of all pages linked on the current page, without changing the current page)

* The old json/xml output formats are now called json-wrapped and xml-wrapped
* Added html and xml output formats, which will just print the elements in their format 
  with the respective headers  
* Added bash output format to export the variables to the shell (e.g. eval $(xidel --output-format bash ...))

* Fix a few xml/html parsing and serialization bugs (e.g. added closing tags for <link>)
* Added an option to print elements as html, instead as xml

* Added support for JSONiq: e.g. object syntax {"a": 123}("a"), arrays [10,20,30](1), the JSONiq jn:* functions,
  additional pxp:json() and pxp:serialize-json functions to parse/serialize JSON

* Added outer-html, inner-html functions to the XPath engine which will serialize the element
  in a string

* The syntax extension of variable inclusion in strings like "$foo;" was replaced by prefixed strings x"{$foo}", the regex extraction function pxp:filter was renamed to pxp:extract, to avoid confusion with the XQuery 3 fn:filter function

* Added support for different http request methods (e.g. PUT), basic authentication, allow arbitrary ports

* Added a system function to run arbitrary commands, a $raw variable containing the raw data of the current page

* Improved detection of CSS/XPath/XQuery kind expressions, also added --css, --xpath, --xquery parameters to easily bypass the detection

* Various other changes

--------Xidel 0.6--------

* Full XQuery 1 support (except XML schema and static type checking, but these are XQuery optional features)

* Added a match function to perform pattern matching between XML documents
* Added a form function to convert a html form in a http request

* Handle '-single quotes in Windows command line
* Support for Windows console OEM encoding

* Fix a few XPath 2 interpreter bugs (e.g. wrong namespace for functions)

--------Xidel 0.5--------
